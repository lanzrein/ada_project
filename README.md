# Title
How much do our Food travel ?


# Abstract (150w approx)
As ecology grows a more important concern, populations need not only to focus on driving less or consuming less, but also on how they consume food. 
It is a known fact that consuming products derived from palm oil, or meat in general is much more damaging for the environment than growing your own vegetables. 
During this project, we aim to expose how to be more regarding towards the environment in our daily food consumption. 
We will use a dataset of the Open Food Facts Database and look into where the food comes and how much it has had to travel. Moreover, in our study, we will take note of what region and countries are leading when it comes to sustainable food and who should take lesson from them. 


# Research questions
- What is the environmental impact of food products ? 
- Who are the worst and who are the best eco friendly consumers ? 
- Compute distance for food from their selling point to origin ( use geopy ) 
  - Look which category of food product travel more. (dry food, preprepared meal)
  - Look if ecological labels such as "Agriculture Biologique" are more aware to the distance travelled by food
- Look at the distance that mineral water in bottle travela
- See what food contains palm oil - is it on the rise ? 
- Is the carbon footprint only related to distance ? 
- Are the newly added product more eco-friendly ?

# Dataset
We will use the Open Food Facts database. We will use mainly the tags such as ‘manufacturing_places’ and ‘countries’. In addition, we will take help of ‘geopy’ to find the coordinate of those place and thus be able to compute the distances. 


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
We first need to extract the data relevant to our project. We will also need to clean up a lot of the data as there is a lot of values that are empty or not filled in yet. 

- 14th of November : Explore the dataset, clean it. 
- 21th of November : Extracting the values that will be relevant for this project, with those values create additional features ( such as distance to origin. )
